There is a triangle of numbers (as in Figure 2). This program calculates the largest sum of the path from the root to the leaf. 
The root is in the the highest level and the leaf is the lowest level, and only paths that start at the root, go through all levels, and end at a leaf are considered.

Input:
The first line specifies the number of samples t. In each t<100 and n<100
Output:
the program calculates a number for each sample containing the largest sum of the path from the root to the leaf.
